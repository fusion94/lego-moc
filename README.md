# LEGO MOC Collection

This is a list of all my LEGO MOCs with links to individual projects.

> LEGO MOC stands for LEGO My Own Creation, or My Own Creation. LEGO MOCs are not official LEGO sets designed and are built by LEGO fans. With LEGO you can really make or recreate everything. Under AFOLs, or Adult Fans of LEGO, there is a lively culture for building MOCs. 
>
> LEGO MOC sets show the great power of LEGO.

## HowTo

All MOCs were designed using [Stud.io](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page) from BrickLink.

## What is Stud.io?

Stud.io is a desktop application that allows users to build LEGO models using virtual parts. Users have the freedom to build anything they want with any LEGO part. By being integrated with the BrickLink catalog, Stud.io can do things like showing you what part colors are unavailable and letting you keep track of part costs. Stud.io also makes it easy to turn a finished creation into a wanted list that you can use to order through BrickLink.

Stud.io is completely free to use and runs on both Windows and Mac. Although a BrickLink account is not necessary to run Stud.io, registered users will have the added bonus of being able to build with friends in real-time.
